<h1>Reval</h1>
---------

Reval is an acronym for relational algebra evaluation.
Reval provieds 

Recommended reading:
Frist read Primes, Table and SetTable to get an overview.
Then check out TableOps and SetTableOps where union, cross-joins etc.
are declared and implemented.

Feel free to submit patches, they are welcome.
Try to stick to the coding standards. No, currently they are not
documented...

<pre>n> module Reval where
> -- TODO: declare exports + export testAll
> import Primes
> import Table
> import TableOps
> import SetTable
> import SetTableOps
</pre>n
<pre>n> testAll = testPrimes
>	-- && testTable && testTableOps -- TODO: impl and call
> 	&& testSetTable && testSetTableOps
</pre>n
<h3>Some Sample Tables</h3>
--------------------------

Some example tables to get you started:

<pre>n> exampleTable1 :: Tab
> exampleTable1 = read (
>	"| ID: Number | Name: String |" ++
>	"| 23 | \"fb\" |" ++
>	"| 42 | \"wabu\" |" ++
>	"| 2 | \"foobar\" |" ++
>	"")
>
> exampleTable2 :: Tab
> exampleTable2 = read (
>	"| ID: Number | Name: String | Student: Bool |" ++
>	"| 23 | \"fb\" | True |" ++
>	"| 42 | \"wabu\" | True |" ++
>	"| 2 | \"foobar\" | False |" ++
>	"")
</pre>n
<pre>n> exampleTableEmpty :: Tab
> exampleTableEmpty = read "||"
</pre>n
try something like:

- cross-join (full outer join):
<pre>ncross exampleTable1 exampleTable2
</pre>n
- select rows with ID == 2
<pre>nselect (\(x:_) -> x == IntLit 2) exampleTable1
</pre>n
- combine queries:  
<pre>nselect (\(x:_) -> x == IntLit 2) exampleTable1
	(cross exampleTable1 exampleTable2)
</pre>n
