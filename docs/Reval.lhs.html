<h1>Reval</h1>

Reval is an acronym for relational algebra evaluation.

<h3>Recommended reading</h3>

Frist read Primes, Table and SetTable to get an overview.
Then check out TableOps and SetTableOps where union, cross-joins etc.
are declared and implemented.

<h3>Version Managment</h3>

We use hg ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial</hl>%28software%29 ) for
version mangement. The hg webinterface can be found at
http://forti.ath.cx:20480/pro/hg/reval/ .
To view the Documentation click on "Manifest" and navigate to "docs" .
The hg changelog is available as an rss-feed:

<h3>Contribute</h3>

Feel free to submit patches, they are welcome.
Try to stick to the coding standards. No, currently they are not
documented...

<h3>Testing</h3>

Run testAll to run unitTests. If testAll returns true, everthing is
fine, otherwise an error is raised.

<pre>> module Reval where
> -- TODO: declare exports + export testAll
> import Primes
> import Table
> import TableOps
> import SetTable
> import SetTableOps
</pre>
<pre>> testAll = testPrimes
>	-- && testTable && testTableOps -- TODO: impl and call
> 	&& testSetTable && testSetTableOps
</pre>
<h3>Some Sample Tables</h3>

Some example tables to get you started:

<pre>> exampleTable1 :: Tab
> exampleTable1 = read (
>	"| ID: Number | Name: String |" ++
>	"| 23 | \"fb\" |" ++
>	"| 42 | \"wabu\" |" ++
>	"| 2 | \"foobar\" |" ++
>	"")
>
> exampleTable2 :: Tab
> exampleTable2 = read (
>	"| ID: Number | Name: String | Student: Bool |" ++
>	"| 23 | \"fb\" | True |" ++
>	"| 42 | \"wabu\" | True |" ++
>	"| 2 | \"foobar\" | False |" ++
>	"")
</pre>
<pre>> exampleTableEmpty :: Tab
> exampleTableEmpty = read "||"
</pre>
<h3>Some pointers to get you started</h3>

try something like:

- cross-join (full outer join):
<pre>cross exampleTable1 exampleTable2
</pre>
- select rows with ID == 2
<pre>select (\(x:</hl>) -> x == IntLit 2) exampleTable1
</pre>
- combine queries:  
<pre>select (\(x:</hl>) -> x == IntLit 2) exampleTable1
	(cross exampleTable1 exampleTable2)
</pre>
