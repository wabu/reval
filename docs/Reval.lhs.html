<h1>Reval</h1>
</br>
Reval is an acronym for relational algebra evaluation.
</br>
<h3>Recommended reading</h3>
</br>
First read Primes, Table and SetTable to get an overview.
Then check out TableOps and SetTableOps where union, cross-joins etc.
are declared and implemented.
</br>
<h3>Version Management</h3>
</br>
We use hg ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial</hl>(software) ) for
version mangement. The hg webinterface can be found at
http://forti.ath.cx:20480/pro/hg/reval/ .
To view the Documentation click on "Manifest" and navigate to "docs" .
The hg changelog is available as an rss-feed:
http://forti.ath.cx:20480/pro/hg/reval/rss-log .

<h3>Contribute</h3>
</br>
Feel free to submit useful patches and bug-reports, they are welcome.
Check out todo.txt and todo.tmp.txt for open tasks.
Try to stick to the coding standards. No, currently they are not
documented...
</br>
<h3>Testing</h3>
</br>
Run testAll to run unitTests. If testAll returns true, everthing is
fine, otherwise an error is raised.
</br>
<pre>> module Reval (
>	testAll,
>	Table(..),
>	TableOps(..),
>	mkTableFromSet,
>	-- TODO: export something else?
> )
> where
> import Primes
> import Table
> import TableOps
> import SetTable
> import SetTableOps
</pre>
<pre>> testAll = testPrimes
>       && testTable && testTableOps
>       && testSetTable && testSetTableOps
</pre>
<h3>Sample Usage</h3>
</br>
If you just want to some simple relational algebra expressions, the most
comfortable way is to put the tables and some expression in a file like this:
</br>
<ul><li>import Primes, SetTable and SetTableOps
</li><li>write table declaration
</li><li>write some queries and call them inside ghci
</li><li>or input queries directly to ghci
</li></ul>
Below is an example, with some table and some queries. Simply load Reval.lhs
into ghci with the following command:
<pre>ghci -fglasgow-exts -i&lt;path/to/reval/src&gt; &lt;your/file&gt;
Now you can view a table, for example, by typing tablePersons, view the result
of a query by evaluating developing or just input your own query, e.g. cross
developing tableProject.
</br>
</br>
<h4>Some Sample Tables</h4>
</br>
Some example tables, you must declare the type type (here it is Tab) and read
in a table, which consists of a header declaration and it rows. Each column is
separated by a |, beginning and ending with a |.  You can use Integer, String,
Bool and Char as types. Literals are formated just like normal Haskell
literals.
</br>
<pre>> tablePersons :: Tab
> tablePersons = read (
>       "| ID: Integer | Name: String | Student: Bool | FavLang: String |" ++
>       "| 23          | \"fb\"       | True          | \"lisp\"        |" ++
>       "| 42          | \"wabu\"     | True          | \"ruby\"        |" ++
>       "| 1337        | \"Schweppe\" | False         | \"haskell\"     |" ++
>       "")
>
> tableProject :: Tab
> tableProject = read (
>       "| Project: String | Supervisor: Integer | Language: String | Detail: String |" ++
>       "| \"reval\" | 12 | \"haskell\"  | \"reval is a relational algebra interpretor\" |" ++
>       "| \"x2c\"   | 23 | \"ruby\"     | \"x2c is a command line client for xmms2\" |" ++
>       "")
>
> tableDeveloper :: Tab
> tableDeveloper = read (
>       "| Dev: Integer | Project: String |" ++
>       "| 23           | \"reval\"       |" ++
>       "| 42           | \"reval\"       |" ++
>       "| 42           | \"x2c\"         |" ++
>       "")
</pre>
<pre>> tableEmpty :: Tab
> tableEmpty = read "|"
</pre>
<pre>> tableID :: Tab
> tableID = read "| ID: Integer || 23 || 42 |"
</pre>
<h4>Some pointers to get you started</h4>
</br>
You can find a full list of operations for table in the class declaration
inside TableOps.lhs. But if you go through the following example and play a
little with the oparations in ghci, you will know everything you need to
know in order to use reval.
</br>
<ul><li>cross-join (full outer join):
</li></ul>
<pre>> testCross = cross tablePersons tableProject
</pre>
<ul><li>select rows with ID == 1337
</li></ul>
<pre>> testSelect = select (\(x:</hl>) -&gt; x == IntLit 1337) tablePersons
</pre>
<ul><li>advanced joins: theta-join tablePerson with tableDeveloper on ID == Dev
</li></ul>
<pre>With the power of Haskell we can create a nice theta join with the condition
separated form theta join, so it will be readable even for larger operations
</pre>
<pre>> testTheta = theta sameID tablePersons tableDeveloper
>       where 
>       sameID person developer = (personID person == developerID developer)
>       personID = getValue tablePersons "ID"
>       developerID = getValue tableDeveloper "Dev"
</pre>
<ul><li>combine queries:  
</li></ul>
<pre>> developing = project ["Name", "Project"] (theta sameID tablePersons tableDeveloper)
>       where 
>       sameID person developer = (personID person == developerID developer)
>       personID = getValue tablePersons "ID"
>       developerID = getValue tableDeveloper "Dev"
</pre>
<pre>> developing' = project ["Name", "Project", "Language", "Detail"] $ natural developing tableProject
</pre>
<pre>> developing'' = project ["Name", "Project"] (left (theta sameID) tablePersons tableDeveloper)
>       where 
>       sameID person developer = (personID person == developerID developer)
>       personID = getValue tablePersons "ID"
>       developerID = getValue tableDeveloper "Dev"
