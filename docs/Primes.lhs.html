<h1>What to put into Tables</h1>

Or how to trick Haskell to get a Table with different data types inside each
column, but with arbitrary length.

<h2>Our First Try</h2>

... in tricking the type system. The type class look good, but still
we got a problem: There is no way to instantiate it.

<pre>> {- the class looks good, but can be instanciated
>
> class (Show a) => Row a where
>       name :: a -> String
>       content :: (Show b, Ord b) => a -> [b]
>
> --type Table = (Row a) => [a]
>
> newtype StringRow = SRow (String, [String])
>       deriving (Show, Eq, Read)
>
> instance Row StringRow where
>       name (SRow (n,_))  = n
>       name _ = error "StringRow.name"
>       content (SRow (_,c)) = c
>       content _ = error "StringRow.content"
> -}
</pre>


<h2>The Second Try</h2>

The idea was to create a TableType as a LISP-like cons-cell to represent Tables.
Trying to ignore the type of the second argument, so we can put a TableType d e
did not work, as the type system came back as we tried to write
typevar a on TableType. The compiler will constructs the type for the function,
but that's an infinite type. Haskell is unable to deal with infinite
types. Compiling the code results in a type error ...


<pre>> {- cant be used either
>
> data TableType a b = Nil | Tab (Row a) b
>        deriving (Show, Eq, Read)
>
>
> names Nil = [] 
> names (Tab (name, _ ) b) = names b -- INFINITE TYPE! BOOM!!
> names _ = error "StringRow.name"
> -}
</pre>


<h2>Finally: Use ASTs</h2>

Well, screw it, just use ASTs to reinvent the wheel^WType system.
Note: Template Haskell might provide a more decent solution, but using
template haskell implies a bunch of nasty foo, like using monads and
having certain compile time constraints. We wanted the Code base to be
readable and understanable by the average student -> No template
haskell. And to be hontest, we did not completly understand template
haskell, anyway ... ;)

<h3>Basic AST Types</h3>
Lit is a Literal.

<pre>> data SimpleLit = Null | IntLit Int | StrLit String | CharLit Char |
>       BoolLit Bool
>       deriving (Eq)
</pre>
Type is used to store Type information in the table schema.
Note: Null has Type Any.

<pre>> data SimpleType = Any | Number | String | Char | Bool
>       deriving (Show, Eq, Read)
</pre>
Now we can just use Lists as rows, as all data just has the type Lit.

<h3>Type System Classes</h3>

As these Types are just not only a short list, we give the user the abillity to
create his own typesystem

<pre>> class (Eq t) => Type t where
>       -- check if to types Are compatible
>       check :: t -> t -> Bool
</pre>
We need glasgow/98 extension because Literal is conjunct to its Type. So we
define the Literal class to have a data l, the literal, and a data t, the type,
where the literal l determinds the type it is based on.

<pre>> class (Type t) => Literal l t | l -> t where
>       -- get the type of a literal
>       getType :: l -> t
>
>       -- check if the Litral is compatible to type
>       checkType :: t -> l -> Bool
>       checkType typ lit = check typ (getType lit)
</pre>
<h3>Implmentation</h3>

Ord for SimpleLit needed to stuff SimpleLits in Sets

<pre>> instance Ord SimpleLit where
>       compare Null Null = EQ
>       compare (IntLit a) (IntLit b) = compare a b 
>       compare (StrLit a) (StrLit b) = compare a b 
>       compare (CharLit a) (CharLit b) = compare a b 
>       compare (BoolLit a) (BoolLit b) = compare a b 
>       -- just to keep it consitent
>       compare Null _ = LT
>       compare _ Null = GT
>       compare (IntLit _) _ = LT
>       compare _ (IntLit _) = GT
>       compare (StrLit _) _ = LT
>       compare _ (StrLit _) = GT
>       compare (CharLit _) _ = LT
>       compare _ (CharLit _) = GT
</pre>
Own Show and Read for SimpleLits

<pre>> showsLit :: SimpleLit -> ShowS
> showsLit Null = ("Null" ++)
> showsLit (IntLit l) = shows l
> showsLit (StrLit l) = shows l
> showsLit (CharLit l) = shows l
> showsLit (BoolLit l) = shows l
> instance Show SimpleLit where showsPrec _ = showsLit
</pre>
<pre>> readsLit :: ReadS SimpleLit
> readsLit s = 
>       [(IntLit l, s) | (l,s) <- reads s ] ++
>       [(StrLit l, s) | (l,s) <- reads s ] ++
>       [(CharLit l, s) | (l,s) <- reads s ] ++
>       [(BoolLit l, s) | (l,s) <- reads s ] ++
>       [(Null,s) | ("Null", s) <- lex s ]
> instance Read SimpleLit where readsPrec _ = readsLit
</pre>
<pre>> instance Type SimpleType where
>       check Any _ = True
>       check _ Any = True
>       check Number Number = True
>       check String String = True
>       check Char Char = True
>       check Bool Bool = True
>       check _ _ = False
</pre>
<pre>> instance Literal SimpleLit SimpleType where
>       getType Null = Any
>       getType (IntLit _) = Number
>       getType (StrLit _) = String
>       getType (CharLit _) = Char
>       getType (BoolLit _) = Bool
</pre>
<h2>UnitTesting</h2>

<pre>> int = IntLit 32
> str = StrLit "wabu"
> chr = CharLit '_'
> bool = BoolLit True
> null = Null
> types = [Number, String, Char, Bool]
> lits  = [int, str, chr, bool]
</pre>
<pre>> testCheck = assertfun2 check "check"
>       ( [(a,a,True) | a <- types] ++
>         [(a,Any,True) | a <- types] ++
>         [(a,Bool,False) | a <- [String,Number,Char]] ++
>         [(a,b,check b a) | a <- types, b <- types] ++
>         [(Any,Any,True)] )
</pre>
<pre>> testCheckType = assertfun2 checkType "checkType"
>       ( [(t,l,True) | (t,l) <- zip types lits] ++
>         [(t,l,False) | i <- [1..4], l <- drop i lits, t <- take i types] ++
