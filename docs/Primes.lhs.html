<h1>What to put into Tables</h1>
</br>
Or how to trick Haskell to get a Table with different data types inside each
column, but with arbitrary length.
</br>
<h2>Our First Try</h2>
</br>
... in tricking the type system. The type class look good, but still
we got a problem: There is no way to instantiate it.
</br>
<pre>> {- the class looks good, but can be instanciated
>
> class (Show a) => Column a where
>       name :: a -> String
>       content :: (Show b, Ord b) => a -> [b]
>
> newtype StringColumn = SColumn (String, [String])
>       deriving (Show, Eq, Read)
>
> instance Column StringColumn where
>       name (SColumn (n,_))  = n
>       content (SColumn (_,c)) = c
> -}
</pre>
Any java programmer would say: yes, this looks good: c is a String, so it
should match the general type b. But as Haskell's type system is a really static
and strict, the code will generate an error:
</br>
<pre>Expected type: [b]
Inferred type: [String]
</pre>
We have to return a value of the general undefined type b, but we want
to create a concrete type instance which should return a [String]. This
implies that our Problem is not solved by this code snipped.
Next try...
</br>
<h2>The Second Try</h2>
</br>
The idea was to create a TableType as a LISP-like cons-cell to represent Tables.
Trying to ignore the type of the second argument, so we can put a TableType d e
did not work, as the type system came back as we tried to write
typevar a on TableType. The compiler will constructs the type for the function,
but that's an infinite type. Haskell is unable to deal with infinite
types. Compiling the code results in a type error ...
</br>
<pre>> {- cant be used either
>
> data TableType a b = Nil | Tab (Row a) b
>        deriving (Show, Eq, Read)
>
>
> names Nil = [] 
> names (Tab (name, _ ) b) = names b -- INFINITE TYPE! BOOM!!
> names _ = error "StringRow.name"
>
> -}
</pre>
</br>
</br>
<h2>Finally: Use ASTs</h2>
</br>
Well, screw it, just use ASTs to reinvent the wheel^WType system.
Note: Template Haskell might provide a more decent solution, but using
template Haskell implies a bunch of nasty foo, like using monads and
having certain compile time constraints. We wanted the Code base to be
readable and understandable by the average student -&gt; No template
Haskell. And to be honest, we did not completely understand template
Haskell, anyway ... ;)
</br>
<h3>Basic AST Types</h3>
</br>
SimpleLit is a Literal, that consists of a type Information and its value.
</br>
<pre>> data SimpleLit = Null | IntLit Int | StrLit String | CharLit Char |
>       BoolLit Bool
>       deriving (Eq)
</pre>
Type is used to store Type information in the table schema.
Note: Null has Type Any.
</br>
<pre>> data SimpleType = Any | Integer | String | Char | Bool
>       deriving (Show, Eq, Read)
</pre>
Now we can just use Lists as rows, as all data inside the row has the same type
Lit.
</br>
<h3>Type System Classes</h3>
</br>
As these Types are just a small fraction of possible values stored inside tables,
we give the user the ability to create his own typesystem and let all thing
work on typeclasses.
A nice exercise is to implement a Type instance for n-arry functions.
This would enable the user to store clousures in a Table.
</br>
<pre>> class (Eq t) =&gt; Type t where
>       check :: t -> t -> Bool
</pre>
We need glasgow/98 extension because Literal is conjunct to its Type. So we
define the Literal class to have a data l, the literal, and a data t, the type,
where the literal l determines the type it is based on.
</br>
<pre>> class (Type t) =&gt; Literal l t | l -&gt; t where
</pre>
The Literal calss has functions to get the type and to check if it matches a
given Type.
</br>
<pre>>       getType :: l -&gt; t
>
>       checkType :: t -> l -> Bool
>       checkType typ lit = check typ (getType lit)
>       getNull :: l
</pre>
<h3>Implmentation</h3>
</br>
Now we can implement these function for our SimpleLit and use it to create
Tables.
</br>
Ord for SimpleLit needed to stuff SimpleLits in Sets
</br>
<pre>> instance Ord SimpleLit where
>       compare Null Null = EQ
>       compare (IntLit a) (IntLit b) = compare a b 
>       compare (StrLit a) (StrLit b) = compare a b 
>       compare (CharLit a) (CharLit b) = compare a b 
>       compare (BoolLit a) (BoolLit b) = compare a b 
>       -- just to keep it consitent
>       compare Null _ = LT
>       compare _ Null = GT
>       compare (IntLit _) _ = LT
>       compare _ (IntLit _) = GT
>       compare (StrLit _) _ = LT
>       compare _ (StrLit _) = GT
>       compare (CharLit _) _ = LT
>       compare _ (CharLit _) = GT
</pre>
Implementation of Show and Read for SimpleLits and Type are straight forward
</br>
<pre>> showsLit :: SimpleLit -&gt; ShowS
> showsLit Null = ("Null" ++)
> showsLit (IntLit l) = shows l
> showsLit (StrLit l) = shows l
> showsLit (CharLit l) = shows l
> showsLit (BoolLit l) = shows l
> instance Show SimpleLit where showsPrec _ = showsLit
</pre>
<pre>> readsLit :: ReadS SimpleLit
> readsLit s = 
>       [(IntLit l, s) | (l,s) <- reads s ] ++
>       [(StrLit l, s) | (l,s) <- reads s ] ++
>       [(CharLit l, s) | (l,s) <- reads s ] ++
>       [(BoolLit l, s) | (l,s) <- reads s ] ++
>       [(Null,s) | ("Null", s) <- lex s ]
> instance Read SimpleLit where readsPrec _ = readsLit
</pre>
And the Type and Literal instance is easy, too.
</br>
<pre>> instance Type SimpleType where
>       check Any _ = True
>       check _ Any = True
>       check Integer Integer = True
>       check String String = True
>       check Char Char = True
>       check Bool Bool = True
>       check _ _ = False
</pre>
<pre>> instance Literal SimpleLit SimpleType where
>       getType Null = Any
>       getType (IntLit _) = Integer
>       getType (StrLit _) = String
>       getType (CharLit _) = Char
>       getType (BoolLit _) = Bool
>
>       getNull = Null
</pre>
<h2>UnitTesting</h2>
</br>
<pre>> int = IntLit 32
> str = StrLit "wabu"
> chr = CharLit '_'
> bool = BoolLit True
> null = Null
> types = [Integer, String, Char, Bool]
> lits  = [int, str, chr, bool]
</pre>
<pre>> testCheck = assertfun2 check "check"
>       ( [(a,a,True) | a <- types] ++
>         [(a,Any,True) | a <- types] ++
>         [(a,Bool,False) | a <- [String,Integer,Char]] ++
>         [(a,b,check b a) | a <- types, b <- types] ++
>         [(Any,Any,True)] )
</pre>
<pre>> testCheckType = assertfun2 checkType "checkType"

>         [(t,l,False) | i <- [1..4], l <- drop i lits, t <- take i types] ++
>         [(t,l,False) | i <- [1..4], l <- take i lits, t <- drop i types] ++
>         [(Any,l,True) | l <- lits] )
